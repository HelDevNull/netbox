	  Mg is a public domain Micro Emacs derivative.	 Created in 1986
	  based on the original MicroEMACS released by Dave Conroy in
	  1985 to comp.sources.unix.

	  The intention is to be a small, fast, and portable Emacs-like
	  editor for users who cannot, or do not want to, run the real
	  Emacs for one reason or another.  Compatibility with GNU Emacs
	  is key for Mg, separating it from other ErsatzEmacs clones,
	  because there should never be any reason to learn more than
	  one Emacs flavor.
