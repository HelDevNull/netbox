	  Brist is a standalone, easy to use, portable framework to
	  verify the capabilities of the Linux bridge.  Emphasis on
	  portable.  It should be possible to run on a full-blown Linux
	  distribution, but it must be possible to run on limited
	  embedded systems.

	  Brist is written in POSIX shell script, with some scent of
	  awk, and uses tools like socat, ping, and tcpdump to do its
	  bidding.  For some tests nemesis is used, but when it is not
	  available, those tests are skipped.
